The project of my internship during my BS Physics studies at ATU in Arkansas.
I was tasked, on my own, with somehow correctly filling in the supersaturated star regions of the SOFIA NASA datasets with the larger, and lower quality, datasets of the Spitzer telescope.
Deciding a custom machine-learning model would suit my interests best, I set out to do just that.
